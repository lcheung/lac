
calibration.avi is a recorded simulation of the touchscreen calibration 
process.  An n x m grid of known size is projected onto the screen.  The
user sequentially touches the grid crossings.  The result of this process
is a reusable calibration file that maps screen touches as recorded by
the camera to device (projector) coordinates.

calibration.avi consists of 42 sequential vertex touches of a 6 x 7 grid.  
Horizontal touches are spaced 70mm apart while vertical touches are spaced
80mm apart.
